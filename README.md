# The Identity Project
Forging identity since 2001.

A proposal for a focussed long term project entailing isomorphism applications research at scale.

### Identity
Identity is the study of what makes data equal.

Your task is to know if the animal you see is equivalent to some reference animal perhaps giving it a name.  In mathematics and computation we direct that task  the task

## Isomorphism Problems List
Given a type of data and an equivalence relation
1. [Counting](#1-counting) Describe the number of equivalence classes, as a function of the parameters.
    1. Growth Counting: Estimate the asymptotic growth of the class, e.g. there are $2^{\Theta(n^2\log n)}$ simple graphs of order $n$ and $2^{\Theta((\log n)^3)}$ groups of order at most $n$.
    1. Enumerative Counting: Give enumerator or formula such as generating function, e.g. the number of groups of order exponent $p$ and order $p^{6}$ is [TBD Look it up].
    1. Filtered Counting: Estimate the number of equivalence classes, as a function of the parameters, that satisfy a given condition.
    
2. [Comparing](#2-comparing) Given two instances in a prescribed computational model decide equivalence.
    1. Comparison Complexity: place the problem along side known problems in complexity.
    2. Comparison Computation: realize algorithms to solve equivalence on specific cases.
    3. Comparison Cateforification: develop a unified model of isomorphism testing using categories. 
3. [Creating](#4-creating) Given a property, sample randomly from the equivalence classes of the objects with that property, or provide an enumera![squirel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65404c4e-be7b-4b8d-8ac8-6fd77bf48bc1)
tor that outputs a stream of such objects.
